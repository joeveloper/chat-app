### ✅ Overview

This project is a **real-time chat application** built using modern full-stack technologies. It enables users to register, log in, join chat rooms, and exchange messages instantly. The application was designed with a focus on real-time communication, secure authentication, and scalable architecture.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Build a **real-time** messaging system using **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**
* Implement **user authentication** with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* Enable **chat room creation and management**
* Persist chat messages in a **PostgreSQL** database
* Create a clean, responsive **React + TypeScript** frontend

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Layer     | Tech Stack                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Frontend  | React, TypeScript, Axios, Socket.IO |
| Backend   | Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, JWT    |
| Database  | PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM       |
| Dev Tools | ESLint, Prettier, Nodemon, Postman  |

---

### 🔧 Architecture

* **Backend API** handles authentication, room and message endpoints
* **WebSocket (Socket.IO)** enables real-time message exchange
* **JWT Authentication** secures routes and socket connections
* **Sequelize** interacts with the PostgreSQL database
* **React Client** manages UI and connects to both REST API and Socket.IO

---

### 📦 Features

* ✅ **User Sign Up / Sign In** with secure password hashing
* ✅ **JWT-Based Authentication** for API and socket
* ✅ **Real-Time Messaging** using WebSockets
* ✅ **Room Creation / Joining**
* ✅ **Message History Persistence** in PostgreSQL
* ✅ **Responsive UI** built with React & TypeScript
* ✅ **Error Handling** and client-server validation

---

### 🧪 Testing

#### Manual Tests

* Auth API tested via **Postman**
* Frontend real-time messaging tested with two browser sessions
* Verified JWT auth & route protection

#### Edge Cases

* Empty room name → blocked with client-side check
* Invalid login → error alert
* Disconnected socket → auto reconnect via Socket.IO

---

### 🚀 Deployment Notes

* Can be containerized via Docker (future enhancement)
* Ready for cloud hosting with PostgreSQL-compatible services (e.g., Heroku, Supabase)

---

### 🐞 Known Issues / Future Improvements

* ⏳ Add message read receipts and typing indicators
* 🔒 Add rate limiting and input sanitization
* 📱 Improve mobile responsiveness
* 🧪 Add unit tests with Jest / React Testing Library

---

### 📚 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a working real-time chat system with modern architecture and solid backend integration. It fulfills the original goals and provides a strong foundation for future scalability and enhancement.
